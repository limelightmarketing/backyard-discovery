First, we participate in the Sustainable Forest program which means that four saplings are planted for each tree removed to make our sets.

Once the play set is securely resting on these solid footings, then you can surround it with your favorite soft material.<\/p>","accordion_title_2":"Q: How much area is required for the play set?","accordion_content_2":"<p>We recommend a 6 foot perimeter around the set and above it for maximum protection against interference with other yard items.<\/p>","accordion_title_3":"Q: How do I get started assembling the set?","accordion_content_3":"<p>We STRONGLY recommend taking out all the parts and laying them on the ground or garage floor before you assemble anything. Match the parts with the parts list in the manual and mark them. This will also help you identify any parts that might be missing. Also, read through your owner’s manual from beginning to end to understand the flow of assembly, this will save you confusion and time.

However, PLEASE make sure YOU inventory all parts FIRST, before the contractor begins any work! If any parts are missing, go to our Support page and follow the prompts to order the parts.

We charge a 15% restocking fee. This is because play sets are heavy, large, and cost a lot to ship back and forth. We want you to be satisfied, but we do not want you to purchase without being absolutely sure this is what you want.<\/p>","accordion_title_2":"Q: What is your return policy?","accordion_content_2":"<p>Please read our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backyarddiscovery.com\/pages\/refund-policy\">return policy<\/a> carefully.

We will send you an email with the tracking number so you can keep tabs on your shipment and plan for its arrival.

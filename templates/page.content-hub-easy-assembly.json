My husband easily put it together over a weekend and only needed a few friends to help when it came time to “raise the roof.” Between the printed instructions and the app called “Bilt” he didn’t have any trouble at all. It is a great space for our large family to relax in the shade or to listen to the rain on the metal roof. We love our gazebo. It’s well worth it.","star_rating":5}},"template--14747948744839__e28a335c-0ed0-4660-aabe-e02a643a7d44-167595783965ce86ee-1":{"type":"quote","settings":{"title":"\"ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS GAZEBO!!\"","paragraph":"This Gazebo has been an absolutely beautiful addition to our backyard outdoor patio! I could not LOVE it more! It arrived in several boxes and was packaged very carefully! All hardware was labeled and easy to find! The assembly does take some time however, the app (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!) was tremendous! It was step by step instructions with CLEAR directions! This avoided any confusion with assembly! Again, the app is fabulous! The roof panels were in excellent shape and easily assembled; however, you will need at least 3 strong men to lift and hold the panels in place in order to assemble the roof! It took about 2 days from start to finish (we completed assembly in a weekend). Once we finished the gazebo, my husband went the extra mile and used pavers to create a pillar around each post. We added solar lights and bought a round table with 6 chairs to complete the space. I absolutely LOVE this gazebo and how it turned out! The quality of all the pieces is superb! I highly recommend this product!!","star_rating":5}},"template--14747948744839__e28a335c-0ed0-4660-aabe-e02a643a7d44-167595783965ce86ee-2":{"type":"quote","settings":{"title":"\"BEST IN CLASS\"","paragraph":"We built this gazebo for our backyard last summer and in my experience it is without a doubt the best in class for a self assembly product of this type.
